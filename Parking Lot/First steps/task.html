<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Parking lots are an urban necessity. They provide places for you to leave your car without having to worry about it being stolen or towed. Modern car parking systems are automated and are capable of self-management. In this project, you will create a similar system, but in a simplified form.</p>

<p>Let's start by writing a program that can place your car in a parking lot and free the lot when the car leaves. This will be the "skeleton" of our functional parking lot, and weâ€™ll add on to it in the following steps. At busy times, the parking lot may run out of vacant spaces. The program will provide us with aggregated information about the current state of the lot.</p>

<h2>Output example</h2>

<p>The first version of your program should just print the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">White car has parked.
Yellow car left the parking lot.
Green car just parked here.</code></pre>
