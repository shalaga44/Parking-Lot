<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In real life, parking lots vary in size. At this stage, we will get better at making art imitate life. To do this, we will make our program customizable by adding a <code class="java">create</code> command that allows the user to specify the number of spots. For example, the command <code class="java">create 3</code> makes a parking lot with three spots. The number of spots should be positive. The program output should be the following: <code class="java">Created a parking lot with 3 spots.</code></p>

<p>Other commands like <code class="java">park</code><strong> </strong>or <code class="java">leave</code><strong> </strong>should return an error <code class="java">Sorry, a parking lot has not been created.</code> until the user enters the <code class="java">create</code><strong> </strong>command. If the user calls <code class="java">create</code><strong> </strong>again, the previous parking state should be reset.</p>

<p>It is also important to keep track of which spaces are occupied by which cars. For this, add a <code class="java">status</code> command that prints all occupied spots in ascending order. For each spot, it should print the spot number, the carâ€™s plate registration number, and the color of the car, all separated by spaces like the example below. If there are no occupied spots, the program should print: <code class="java">Parking lot is empty.</code></p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p> The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; park KA-01-HH-9999 White
