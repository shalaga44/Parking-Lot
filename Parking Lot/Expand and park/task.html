<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Two spots are not enough for a parking lot, so let's increase the number of parking spaces. We'll jump straight to 20 spaces, numbered from 1 to 20. Initially, all the spots are vacant.</p>

<p>When the user wants to park the car, the program should find an available parking spot with the lowest number.</p>

<p>The user can write commands <code class="java">park</code><strong> </strong>and <code class="java">leave</code><strong> </strong>repeatedly and type <code class="java">exit</code> to end the program.</p>

<p>If the parking lot is full and there's no room, the program should type <code class="java">Sorry, the parking lot is full.</code>.</p>

<p>If there are several available spots for a car, the program should always assign the spot with the lowest number.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p> The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; park KA-01-HH-9999 White
